I am working my way up in the software field. Before I chose this path, I was interested in physics but frustrated with academia. In past lives, I've also been a real estate agent, bought and sold my own home, qualified for a class A truck driver's license, been a poor restaurant employee, held the humbling position of political petitioner (the ones that badger you in front of stores and malls), worked in the dessert finding weather beacon thingys, and moved dirt manually with metallic wedge tools (ditch digging, my first 'job').

I enjoy communicating my position on topics, and problem-solving with people is something I've spent a lot of time doing. For several years, volunteered for a local non-profit: creating and publishing videos on their YouTube channel, lobbying the California and federal legislature, and delivering a number of public speeches.

As a youngster, I played every sport possible and developed an encyclopedic knowledge for football primarily, but baseball to some degree as well. I still play, primarily via adult intramurals and a local powerlifting gym; I wouldn't be myself if I couldn't.

I was also a Boy Scout, and with the support of an excellent group of people, I both earned my Eagle Scout award and temporarily continued working with them on a couple Search and Rescue teams. I'm pretty laidback regarding my outdoor adventures; it's not a race to climb the largest mountains, camp at the most name brand parks, or look the coolest while doing it. That being said, I've seen a lot of California, I've flown a plane and jumped out of one (while it was still perfectly good), and I've been to just about every state and major city in the US, Canada, and Mexico. It's on my to-do list to see more of the other continents first-hand.

My grandmother likes to tell me that, as a child, I was diagnosed with a long attention span. I've checked the internet, and this doesn't need to be a real medical term. In any case, it's pretty descriptive. I've spent much of my 20s putting that attention to good use, learning a lot about a lot of different subjects. Other than in my projects section, you can see some of thoughts about these subjects in my blog.
